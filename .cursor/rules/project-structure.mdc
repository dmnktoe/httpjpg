# Project Structure

The repository is organized into top-level `apps` and `packages` directories, each with focused subfolders.

## Apps

- `apps/docs` – Project documentation.
- `apps/storybook-ui` – Storybook UI preview app.
- `apps/web` – Main application.
  All frontend-only code (Next.js App Router) goes in `apps/web/app`.

## Packages

All backend, utility, and shared logic is modularized under `packages/`, each with its own responsibility:

- `packages/env` – Environment variables and config.
- `packages/eslint-config-custom` – Custom eslint rules for workspace.
- `packages/fonts` – Font files and configuration.
- `packages/middleware-chain` – Composable middlewares.
- `packages/next-api-fetcher` – Next.js API fetch logic.
- `packages/next-link` – Next.js link helpers.
- `packages/next-themes` – Theme management.
- `packages/storyblok-api` – Storyblok API integration logic.
- `packages/storyblok-preview` – Preview mode handling for Storyblok.
- `packages/storyblok-revalidate` – Revalidation logic for Storyblok content.
- `packages/storyblok-richtext` – Helpers for rich text rendering from Storyblok.
- `packages/storyblok-seo` – SEO utilities connected to Storyblok data.
- `packages/storyblok-setup` – Storyblok SDK setup.
- `packages/storyblok-ui` – Storyblok-powered UI components, adapted from ui package.
- `packages/storyblok-utils` – Utility functions for Storyblok.
- `packages/storybook` – Storybook config and stories for design system.
- `packages/tailwind-config` – Shared TailwindCSS configuration.
- `packages/tsconfig` – Shared TypeScript configuration.
- `packages/ui` – Shared React components and UI primitives.
- `packages/utils` – General-purpose utilities and helper functions.
- `config` contains the application configuration

## Guidelines

- Place all frontend-only Next.js code in `apps/web/app`.
- Documentation and UI previews go in `apps/docs` and `apps/storybook-ui`.
- Add backend logic and reusable packages only in the relevant `packages/` subfolder.
- Each functionality is isolated as its own package—follow this convention for new domains.
